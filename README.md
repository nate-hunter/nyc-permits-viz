- A data visualization project using data obtained from NYC Open Data.

1. Which burrough issued the most total permits?
2. Which burrough issued the most permits for each year?
3. Which were the most common types of permits issued?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### WHY THIS PROJECT:
- Practice creating data visualizations with D3.js (for future use, especially w/NBA Contracts projet)
- This dataset relates to my past experience as an envrionmental consultant who managed projects related to MS4 (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer) permits.
- I can utilize this data to create graphs, charts, AND MAPS! 
- This project is frontend only so it can be easily viewed on GitHub Pages.
