- A data visualization project using data from NYC Open

- This project addresses the following questions:
1. Which burrough issued the most permits by year?
2. Which were the most common type of permits issued?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### WHY THIS PROJECT:
- practice D3.js on a simple dataset (for future use, especially w/NBA Contracts projet)
- tie in past life, giving my resume some continuity and puropse
- can use data to create graphs and charts, AND maps. 
- frontend only so can easily host on github pages.
